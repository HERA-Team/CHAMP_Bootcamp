# Lesson 7: Interferometry and Synthesis Imaging

The goal of this lesson is to obtain a basic familiarity with radio interferometry imaging. We'll see a bit of CASA which is a standard toolset which is common in radio astronomy though somewhat more rarely by HERA people. 


* We'll be using this [Tutorial](HERA_CHAMP_Interferometry_tutorial.md).

## Setup
Each in-person tutorial has its own particular setup.
