# Introductory and Advanced Python

This lesson combines content from both the Introductory and Advanced Python tutorials. The material presented here
is based on the [Software Carpentry Tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html), but
with different topics emphasized in an attempt to better prepare the student for HERA-related work given the time
constraints.

## Notes for Students
You should work through the [Software Carpentry Tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html),
as well as the [Example Notebook](./Demo.ipynb), on your own to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of
coding with Python.

## Notes for Instructors
The [Software Carpentry Tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html) and
[Example Notebook](./Demo.ipynb) form the foundation of the courses. These are not meant to be worked through
verbatim in the lessons, but are meant to be used as guides for the instructors and references for the students.
It is recommended to demonstrate the course content using an interactive session, preferably either the iPython
interpreter or a Jupyter notebook. The goal of these tutorials is to prepare students with a minimum of knowledge
necessary to start coding with Python, teach good coding practice *through example*, and develop a basic level of
familiarity with debugging tools.
