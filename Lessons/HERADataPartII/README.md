#### Lesson Outline
1. Calibration Overview + Demo
2. Review of Imaging Specs
3. HERA Imaging Demo

#### Learning Objectives
1. Gain intuition for why calibration is important and how we do it
2. Gain familiarity with HERA's imaging capabilities
3. Make some images with HERA data

Jupyter Notebook setup:
1. Run `ssh <user>@login.aoc.nrao.edu -L 8000:herapost-master:8000` to ssh into the NRAO machines
2. Type `localhost:8000` on your browser to start a Jupyter Notebook session

2022 Notes:
1. All the demos are designed to run on NRAO with Jupyter Notebooks. Please have the NRAO account setup with the tunneling to run Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Data files are stored on NRAO lustre, which should be accessible directly for everyone.
3. Please run `cp /users/zxu/XTerm ~/` to enable copy/paste in the CASA interface.
